# Mathbook

### Purpose
Sandbox for algorithms and theorems observed in Math courses. 
This includes basic arithmatic functions to Integrals, Linear Algebra, Belzouts, Extended Euclidean, or base conversions, etc.

### Instructions
To use, just compile calc.cpp, ./a.out, then follow the prompted commands to 
clauclate whatever desired.

### Completed Algorithms (Alphabetical)
This includes list of all algorithms being worked on and desired to achieve in the near future
